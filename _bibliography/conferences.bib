  abstract={Visual fidelity affects the user experience and performance in virtual environments. While past studies have explored its effects, most have relied on qualitative measures, and few quantitative studies have specified visual quality standards. This study examined the influence of visual fidelity on task performance and mental workload in immersive virtual environments (IVEs). Two environmental models were tested in virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR): a high-visual quality model featuring detailed materials, realistic lighting, and outdoor scenery, and a low-fidelity research model with basic colors, dimensional lighting, and no external views. Sixty participants completed cognitive tasks (digit span, spatial working memory updating, go/no-go), while the EEG measured mental workload. The results showed that high-fidelity increased the cognitive load in complex tasks, whereas MR environments supported better performance. These findings emphasize the need to balance realism and cognitive demands to optimize virtual experiences.},
